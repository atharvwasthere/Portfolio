## Why This Portfolio Matters to Me

This portfolio is more than just a website, it’s a piece of me.
I didn’t want to copy-paste someone else’s design because it wouldn’t feel like me.

## The Journey

* It all started with **scribbles on paper**, where I drafted ideas of what I wanted to showcase.
* Then came **basic wireframes**, turning those ideas into a structured plan.
* I moved to **Figma**, experimenting, designing, and iterating — not once, not twice, but **three times**, until it felt perfect to me.
* Every section reflects my personality, my skills, and my goals — from **blogs I write** to **projects I build**.

## The Purpose

This portfolio is not just about aesthetics; it is about **telling my story** —
Who I am,
What I do,
What I plan to achieve.

## The Outcome

After countless revisions, what emerged was a **polished product**, built with intention, creativity, and a vision of what I want the world to see.
