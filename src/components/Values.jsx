As a third-year Computer Science student, I&apos;ve learned a lot from building projects from the ground up, and this hands-on experience has ignited a drive in me to leave no stone unturned. I&apos;m passionate about crafting efficient, reliable, and scalable solutions that meet real needs, blending functionality with thoughtful design. Working with a team inspires meâ€”I believe that <strong>collaboration leads to outcomes far greater than what we can achieve individually</strong>. I like to think big, work quickly but thoughtfully, and always keep an eye on the bigger picture. I&apos;m constantly growing, improving, and pushing myself to execute at the highest level.</p>
